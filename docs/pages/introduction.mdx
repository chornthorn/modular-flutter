description: A comprehensive Flutter starter project with modular architecture
---

**Modular Flutter** is a comprehensive Flutter starter project that implements a clean, scalable modular architecture with dependency injection, state management, and multi-platform support.

## What is Modular Flutter?

Modular Flutter provides a solid foundation for building large-scale Flutter applications with:

- **Clean Architecture**: Feature-based modules with clear boundaries
- **Dependency Injection**: Service locator pattern with GetIt
- **State Management**: Custom ViewModel pattern built on Riverpod
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive error handling with Result types
- **Multi-Platform**: Support for Android, iOS, Web, and Desktop

## Key Features

### Modular Architecture

- **Feature Modules**: Each feature is encapsulated in its own module
- **Dependency Injection**: Automatic dependency resolution
- **Clean Separation**: Clear boundaries between layers

### State Management

- **ViewModel Pattern**: Business logic separation from UI
- **Riverpod Integration**: Reactive state management
- **Type-Safe States**: Using Freezed for immutable state classes

### Developer Experience

- **Code Generation**: Automatic code generation for boilerplate
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and integration test setup
- **Multi-Platform**: Single codebase for all platforms

## Getting Started

Ready to start building with Modular Flutter? Check out our [Quick Start Guide](/quick-start) to set up your first project.

## Architecture Overview

The architecture consists of three main packages:

- **[modular_core](/architecture/modular-core)**: Core architecture components
- **[modular_flutter](/architecture/modular-flutter)**: Flutter-specific implementations
- **[viewmodel](/architecture/viewmodel)**: State management solution

## Example Implementation

The project includes a complete **Post Module** that demonstrates:

- CRUD operations with repository pattern
- ViewModel state management
- Error handling with Result types
- Navigation with GoRouter
