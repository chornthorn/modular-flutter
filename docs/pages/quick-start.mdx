description: Get up and running with Modular Flutter in minutes
---

Get your Modular Flutter project up and running in just a few minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (3.8.1+)
- [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart) (3.8.1+)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Step 1: Create a New Project

```bash
flutter create my_modular_app
cd my_modular_app
```

## Step 2: Add Dependencies

Add the Modular Flutter packages to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  # Modular Flutter packages
  modular_flutter:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/chornthorn/modular-flutter.git
      path: packages/modular_flutter
      ref: main
  viewmodel:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/chornthorn/modular-flutter.git
      path: packages/viewmodel
      ref: main

  # Additional dependencies
  http: ^1.1.0

dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter

  # Code generation
  build_runner: ^2.4.7
  freezed: ^3.1.0
  json_serializable: ^6.7.1
```

## Step 3: Install and Run

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Your app should now be running! You'll see a simple home screen with a button to navigate to the Posts module.

## Step 4: Explore the Architecture

The example app demonstrates:

- **Module Registration**: How modules are registered and initialized
- **Dependency Injection**: Services and repositories automatically injected
- **State Management**: ViewModel pattern with Riverpod
- **Navigation**: GoRouter integration for deep linking

## Next Steps

Now that you have the project running, explore these key areas:

### 1. **Understand the Architecture**

- Read the [Architecture Overview](/architecture/overview)
- Explore each package: [modular_core](/architecture/modular-core), [modular_flutter](/architecture/modular-flutter), [viewmodel](/architecture/viewmodel)

### 2. **Create Your First Module**

- Follow the [Creating Modules Guide](/guides/creating-modules)
- Learn about [Dependency Injection](/guides/dependency-injection)

### 3. **Explore Examples**

- Study the [Post Module Example](/examples/post-module)
- See how [State Management](/guides/state-management) works

### 4. **Set Up Testing**

- Learn about [Testing Strategies](/guides/testing)
- Run tests with `melos test`

## Common Commands

Here are the most useful commands for development:

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Generate code (freezed, json_serializable)
dart run build_runner build

# Format code
dart format .

# Analyze code
flutter analyze

# Clean build
flutter clean

# Check for outdated dependencies
flutter pub outdated
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

If you encounter build issues:

1. **Clean and rebuild**:

   ```bash
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. **Generate code**:

   ```bash
   dart run build_runner clean
   dart run build_runner build
   ```

3. **Check Flutter version**:
   ```bash
   flutter --version
   ```

### Missing Dependencies

If you see import errors:

1. **Reinstall dependencies**:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

2. **Check pubspec.yaml** for correct version constraints

### IDE Setup

For the best development experience:

- **VS Code**: Install Flutter and Dart extensions
- **Android Studio**: Install Flutter plugin
- **IntelliJ IDEA**: Install Flutter plugin
